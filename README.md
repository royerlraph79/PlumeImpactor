## Structure

The project is seperated in multiple modules, all serve single or multiple uses depending on their importance.

| Module               | Description                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/plumeimpactor` | GUI interface for the crates shown below, backend using wxWidgets (with a rust ffi wrapper, wxDragon)                         |
| `apps/plumesign`     | Simple CLI interface for signing, using `clap`.                                                                       |
| `crates/grand_slam`  | Handles all api request used for communicating with Apple developer services, along with providing auth for Apple's grandslam |
| `crates/utils`       | Shared code between GUI and CLI, contains signing and modification logic, and helpers.  |

## Building

Building is going to be a bit convoluted for each platform, each having their own unique specifications, but the best reference for building should be looking at how the our [GitHub actions](./github/workflows/build.yml) does it.

You need:
- Rust
- CMake (and a c++ compiler)

```sh
# Applies our patches in ./patches 
cargo install patch-crate
cargo fetch --locked && cargo patch-crate --force
# Building / testing
cargo run --bin plumeimpactor
```

Extra requirements are shown below for building if you don't have these already, and trust me, it is convoluted.

#### Linux Requirements

```sh
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libclang-dev pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxkbcommon-dev libexpat1-dev libtiff-dev

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install clang-devel pkg-config gtk3-devel libpng-devel libjpeg-devel mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel libxkbcommon-devel expat-devel libtiff-devel
```

#### macOS Requirements
- Xcode or Command Line Tools

#### Windows Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019 or later (Community/Professional/Build Tools)
- Windows 10 or 11 SDK
- x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019/2022
